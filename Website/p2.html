So how does one change permalink structure? It’s actually very simple, simply navigate to Settings -> Permalinks and change the default to something else:
When starting off with your self-hosted blog (using WordPress.org), all you need to spend money on is a domain, a web hosting service and a nice looking, feature rich, premium theme. You don’t need anything else, at least not for a while, you will need to spend more down the road when your blog starts getting lots of traffic.
When budgeting you should try to shoot for two birds. In other words, instead of buying a web hosting service and
 then purchasing a domain name, do both. Some web hosting services offer a free domain name for one year in addition to your hosting.
 A few select others offer a free domain name for life as well as your hosting package. Since I like budgeting, 
this is the option I choose. GreenGeeks offers you a free domain name for life (saving you $10-$15 a year) to go along with
 your web hosting service. </p>

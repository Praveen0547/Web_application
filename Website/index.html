<h1> why we are different from other</h1>
<p>
Unlike the previous four content aggregator websites, AffBuzz is a very narrow content sharing option that aggregates content related to affiliate marketing only. If you have a quality blog that is related to affiliate marketing you can try your luck and recommend that your site be listed.
One thing to know about AffBuzz, they typically don’t list new websites, even if those websites have high quality articles. They also prefer that you already have a decent amount of visitors/readership to your blog.
Those are just several, of many, content aggregators. If you want my recommendation, I would go after only two or three, preferably AllTop and Blogengage (if you don’t mind spending a little). Also, don’t get discouraged if you are rejected. Many content aggregators are extremely selective about which blogs they include. But if you do get included, be sure to read the FAQs and Guidelines as some aggregators have conditions for your listing, such as with AllTop who will hide your feed if you don’t post after 28 days.

Alltop is the best Content Aggregator website, it has an alexa rank of 6,800 (as of this writing) and a pagerank of 6. Best of all, Alltop gives you a dofollow link to your content.
The catch? It is extremely difficult to get listed on Alltop. 
You really need to offer top quality content if you want you blog to get listed on their website, but it is possible, 
even for newer websites. For example, this website was able to get listed on Alltop 24 hours after
 applying (while being less than a month old at the time), now I am featured on their WordPress category 
page and have even gotten posts featured in their “Most Topular Stories” (Topular not a typo) section. </p>

<h3>Aggregator Revenue Model</h3>

As already stated above, the good/service providers are the real customers of the aggregators.
•	Aggregators provide them with the customers and in return charge some commission. (Uber Business Model), or
•	The partners quote the minimum price at which they’ll operate and the aggregators, after adding up the take up rate, quote the final price to the consumer. (Oyo Business Model)
This method isn’t always in operation. The revenue generation is different for different business stage, cycle, and season. There is a big role of discounts and surge pricing in determining the total revenue generation by the aggregators. They might
1.	Aggregator visits the Good/service providers.
2.	Aggregator promises him more customers and proposes a partnership plan.
3.	Service providers are now the partners.
4.	Aggregator builds up his own brand and tries to attract customers through many marketing strategies.
5.	Customers make purchases through the aggregator.
6.	Partners get the customers as promised.
7.	Aggregator gets the commission.

 Choosing the best, feature rich theme is important for so many reasons. SEO isn’t the only one of them, having a theme that functions the way you want it is crucial for the design aspect of your website and helps make your blog look more professional (which will keep visitors on your website longer). If you have limited customization options for your theme then you will most likely be left with a rather bland looking blog.
Instead, pick a theme from a reputable developing company. I do not ever recommend that you use a free WordPress theme for a variety of reasons. I’ll give you the short version though, free WordPress themes typically come with very limited customization options and don’t have many features – such as a built-in, lightweight social share bar, built-in related posts and custom widgets.
If you are looking for a professional theme then you might check out MyThemeShop (which is what this website uses).

Often it is a point of confusion when those wanting to start their own blog with WordPress find out that there
 are in fact two WordPress versions. So which one are you supposed to choose, WordPress.com or WordPress.org? 
You need to understand the core differences between each so that you are able to choose the best platform. </p>

<h3>your requirement is our service </h3>
While they both have their advantages and disadvantages, if you are wanting to start a professional blog that you want to eventually 
make money from and customize, then I highly recommend you use WordPress.org. You can even read about how to use WordPress.org
 to start your own blog here. With WordPress.org you are able to have full control over when and where to display ads, customization, 
plugins and relatively cheap premium themes. However, if you are looking to start a casual blog that you will only post to a few times
 a month (non-serious websites in other words) then WordPress.com may be your best bet.

This one is extremely important and potentially devastating. Important because changing your permalinks from the default,
 which looks something like this: tomakeawebsite.net/p=123truesoigwesjoigjeoitgj, to something else is important for your SEO. If your default permalink structure is left, then URL’s will not be SEO friendly. Not only is changing permalinks important for your SEO but it is also potentially devastating later on. For example, should you ever want to change your permalinks after your website has been live for a while, then all of the backlinks pointing at your blog will be no more (since the URL’s of your pages will have changed).
